## [Processing a Guess](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#processing-a-guess)

By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude, and you can see everything in it [in the standard library documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).

### [Storing Values with Variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables)

`String` is a string type provided by the standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

### [Receiving User Input](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#receiving-user-input)

The stdin function returns an instance of `std::io::Stdin`, which is a type that represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.

The full job of `read_line` is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument.

The `&` indicates that this argument is a reference, which gives you a way to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to copy that data into memory multiple times. 

### [Handling Potential Failure with the `Result` Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type)

An instance of Result has an expect method that you can call. If this instance of `Result` is an `Err` value, expect will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to expect.

In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.

### [Printing Values with `println!` Placeholders](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#printing-values-with-println-placeholders)

The `{}` set of curly brackets is a placeholder: think of `{}` as little crab pincers that hold a value in place.

### [Using a Crate to Get More Functionality](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality)

The `rand crate` is a library crate, which contains code intended to be used in other programs and can't be executed on its own.

Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from [Crates.io](https://crates.io/).

#### [Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the _Cargo.lock_ File](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file)

In other words, your project will remain at `0.8.3` until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the _Cargo.lock_ file.

### [Generating a Random Number](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number)

First, we add the line use `rand::Rng`. The `Rng` trait defines methods that random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to use those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.

In the first line, we call the `rand::thread_rng` function that gives us the particular random number generator that we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of execution and seeded by the operating system. Then we call the `gen_range` method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the Rng trait that we brought into scope with the use `rand::Rng` statement. 

## [Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number)

The `cmp` method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared.

Shadowing lets us reuse the `guess` variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as `guess_str` and `guess` for example. We’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 3, but for now know that this feature is often used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.

(On Windows, pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, `\r\n`).

### [Handling Invalid Input](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-invalid-input)

The underscore, `_`, is a catchall value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all Err values, no matter what information they have inside them.
