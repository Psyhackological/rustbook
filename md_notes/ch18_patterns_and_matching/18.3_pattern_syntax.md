## [Pattern Syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#pattern-syntax)

### [Matching Literals](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#matching-literals)

```rust
    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 => println!("one"),
        2 => println!("two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }
```

### [Matching Named Variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#matching-named-variables)

Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and we’ve used them many times in the book. However, there is a complication when you use named variables in `match` expressions. Because `match` starts a new scope, variables declared as part of a pattern inside the `match` expression will shadow those with the same name outside the `match` construct, as is the case with all variables.

```rust
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
        Some(y) => println!("Matched, y = {y}"),
        _ => println!("Default case, x = {:?}", x),
    }

    println!("at the end: x = {:?}, y = {y}", x);
```

```bash
Matched, y = 5
at the end: x = Some(5), y = 10
```

To create a `match` expression that compares the values of the outer `x` and `y`, rather than introducing a shadowed variable, we would need to use a match guard conditional instead.

### [Multiple Patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#multiple-patterns)

In `match` expressions, you can match multiple patterns using the `|` syntax, which is the pattern _or_ operator.

```rust
    let x = 1;

    match x {
        1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
        3 => println!("three"),
        _ => println!("anything"),
    }
```

### [Matching Ranges of Values with `..=`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#matching-ranges-of-values-with-)

```rust
    let x = 5;

    match x {
        1..=5 => println!("one through five"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    
```

The compiler checks that the range isn’t empty at compile time, and because the only types for which Rust can tell if a range is empty or not are `char` and numeric values, ranges are only allowed with numeric or `char` values.

```rust
    let x = 'c';

    match x {
        'a'..='j' => println!("early ASCII letter"),
        'k'..='z' => println!("late ASCII letter"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
```

### [Destructuring to Break Apart Values](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#destructuring-to-break-apart-values)

We can also use patterns to destructure structs, enums, and tuples to use different parts of these values. Let’s walk through each value.

#### [Destructuring Structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#destructuring-structs)

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, a);
    assert_eq!(7, b);
}
```

Because of this common usage, and because writing `let Point { x: x, y: y } = p;` contains a lot of duplication, Rust has a shorthand for patterns that match struct fields: you only need to list the name of the struct field, and the variables created from the pattern will have the same names.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    let Point { x, y } = p;
    assert_eq!(0, x);
    assert_eq!(7, y);
}
```

We can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern rather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test some of the fields for particular values while creating variables to destructure the other fields.

```rust
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

    match p {
        Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {x}"),
        Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y axis at {y}"),
        Point { x, y } => {
            println!("On neither axis: ({x}, {y})");
        }
    }
}
```

Remember that a `match` expression stops checking arms once it has found the first matching pattern, so even though `Point { x: 0, y: 0}` is on the `x` axis and the `y` axis, this code would only print `On the x axis at 0`.

#### [Destructuring Enums](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#destructuring-enums)

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);

    match msg {
        Message::Quit => {
            println!("The Quit variant has no data to destructure.");
        }
        Message::Move { x, y } => {
            println!("Move in the x direction {x} and in the y direction {y}");
        }
        Message::Write(text) => {
            println!("Text message: {text}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {
            println!("Change the color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}",)
        }
    }
}
```

#### [Destructuring Nested Structs and Enums](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#destructuring-nested-structs-and-enums)

```rust
enum Color {
    Rgb(i32, i32, i32),
    Hsv(i32, i32, i32),
}

enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(Color),
}

fn main() {
    let msg = Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(0, 160, 255));

    match msg {
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Rgb(r, g, b)) => {
            println!("Change color to red {r}, green {g}, and blue {b}");
        }
        Message::ChangeColor(Color::Hsv(h, s, v)) => {
            println!("Change color to hue {h}, saturation {s}, value {v}")
        }
        _ => (),
    }
}
```

#### [Destructuring Structs and Tuples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#destructuring-structs-and-tuples)

```rust
   let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });
```

#### [Ignoring an Entire Value with `_`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#ignoring-an-entire-value-with-_)

```rust
fn foo(_: i32, y: i32) {
    println!("This code only uses the y parameter: {}", y);
}

fn main() {
    foo(3, 4);
}
```

In most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter, you would change the signature so it doesn’t include the unused parameter. Ignoring a function parameter can be especially useful in cases when, for example, you're implementing a trait when you need a certain type signature but the function body in your implementation doesn’t need one of the parameters. You then avoid getting a compiler warning about unused function parameters, as you would if you used a name instead.

#### [Ignoring Parts of a Value with a Nested `_`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#ignoring-parts-of-a-value-with-a-nested-_)

We can also use `_` inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value, for example, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use for the other parts in the corresponding code we want to run. Listing 18-18 shows code responsible for managing a setting’s value. The business requirements are that the user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customization of a setting but can unset the setting and give it a value if it is currently unset.

```rust
  let mut setting_value = Some(5);
    let new_setting_value = Some(10);

    match (setting_value, new_setting_value) {
        (Some(_), Some(_)) => {
            println!("Can't overwrite an existing customized value");
        }
        _ => {
            setting_value = new_setting_value;
        }
    }

    println!("setting is {:?}", setting_value);
```

We can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to ignore particular values.

```rust
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (first, _, third, _, fifth) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {third}, {fifth}")
        }
    }
```

#### [Ignoring an Unused Variable by Starting Its Name with `_`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#ignoring-an-unused-variable-by-starting-its-name-with-_)

```rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 5;
    let y = 10;
}
```

Here we get a warning about not using the variable `y`, but we don’t get a warning about not using `_x`.

```rust
    let s = Some(String::from("Hello!"));

    if let Some(_s) = s {
        println!("found a string");
    }

    println!("{:?}", s);
```

> Listing 18-21: An unused variable starting with an underscore still binds the value, which might take ownership of the value


```rust
    let s = Some(String::from("Hello!"));

    if let Some(_) = s {
        println!("found a string");
    }

    println!("{:?}", s);
```

This code works just fine because we never bind `s` to anything; it isn’t moved.

#### [Ignoring Remaining Parts of a Value with `..`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#ignoring-remaining-parts-of-a-value-with-)

With values that have many parts, we can use the `..` syntax to use specific parts and ignore the rest, avoiding the need to list underscores for each ignored value.

```rust
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
        z: i32,
    }

    let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 };

    match origin {
        Point { x, .. } => println!("x is {}", x),
    }
```

The syntax `..` will expand to as many values as it needs to be. Listing 18-24 shows how to use `..` with a tuple.

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (first, .., last) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {first}, {last}");
        }
    }
}
```

However, using `..` must be unambiguous. If it is unclear which values are intended for matching and which should be ignored, Rust will give us an error.

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = (2, 4, 8, 16, 32);

    match numbers {
        (.., second, ..) => {
            println!("Some numbers: {}", second)
        },
    }
}
```

### [Extra Conditionals with Match Guards](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#extra-conditionals-with-match-guards)

A _match guard_ is an additional `if` condition, specified after the pattern in a `match` arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards are useful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows.

```rust
    let num = Some(4);

    match num {
        Some(x) if x % 2 == 0 => println!("The number {} is even", x),
        Some(x) => println!("The number {} is odd", x),
        None => (),
    }
```

There is no way to express the `if x % 2 == 0` condition within a pattern, so the match guard gives us the ability to express this logic. The downside of this additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn't try to check for exhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    let y = 10;

    match x {
        Some(50) => println!("Got 50"),
        Some(n) if n == y => println!("Matched, n = {n}"),
        _ => println!("Default case, x = {:?}", x),
    }

    println!("at the end: x = {:?}, y = {y}", x);
}
```

```rust
    let x = 4;
    let y = false;

    match x {
        4 | 5 | 6 if y => println!("yes"),
        _ => println!("no"),
    }
```

### [`@` Bindings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#-bindings)

The _at_ operator `@` lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same time as we’re testing that value for a pattern match. In Listing 18-29, we want to test that a `Message::Hello` `id` field is within the range `3..=7`. We also want to bind the value to the variable `id_variable` so we can use it in the code associated with the arm. We could name this variable `id`, the same as the field, but for this example we’ll use a different name.

```rust
    enum Message {
        Hello { id: i32 },
    }

    let msg = Message::Hello { id: 5 };

    match msg {
        Message::Hello {
            id: id_variable @ 3..=7,
        } => println!("Found an id in range: {}", id_variable),
        Message::Hello { id: 10..=12 } => {
            println!("Found an id in another range")
        }
        Message::Hello { id } => println!("Found some other id: {}", id),
    }
```

## [Summary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#summary)

Rust’s patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different kinds of data. When used in `match` expressions, Rust ensures your patterns cover every possible value, or your program won’t compile. Patterns in `let` statements and function parameters make those constructs more useful, enabling the destructuring of values into smaller parts at the same time as assigning to variables. We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.
