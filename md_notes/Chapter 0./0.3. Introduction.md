### [People Who Value Speed and Stability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch00-00-introduction.html#people-who-value-speed-and-stability)

By striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features that compile to lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust endeavors to make safe code be fast code as well.

Overall, Rustâ€™s greatest ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for decades by providing safety _and_ productivity, speed _and_ ergonomics.
