## [Concise Control Flow with `if let`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-03-if-let.html#concise-control-flow-with-if-let)

```rust
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max),
        _ => (),
    }
```

The following code behaves the same as the `match`

```rust
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {}", max);
    }
```

The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the `match` and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is `Some(max)`, and the `max` binds to the value inside the `Some`. We can then use `max` in the body of the `if let` block in the same way as we used `max` in the corresponding `match` arm. The code in the `if let` block isn’t run if the value doesn’t match the pattern.

Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However, you lose the exhaustive checking that `match` enforces.

In other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.
