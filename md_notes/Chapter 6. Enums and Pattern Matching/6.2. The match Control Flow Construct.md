## [The `match` Control Flow Construct](file:///home/konradkon/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/doc/rust/html/book/ch06-02-match.html#the-match-control-flow-construct)

Think of a `match` expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go through each pattern in a `match`, and at the first pattern the value “fits,” the value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.

This seems very similar to an expression used with `if`, but there’s a big difference: with `if`, the expression needs to return a Boolean value, but here, it can return any type.

If you want to run multiple lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma following the arm is then optional.

### [Patterns that Bind to Values](file:///home/konradkon/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/doc/rust/html/book/ch06-02-match.html#patterns-that-bind-to-values)

When a `Coin::Quarter` matches, the `state` variable will bind to the value of that quarter’s state.
