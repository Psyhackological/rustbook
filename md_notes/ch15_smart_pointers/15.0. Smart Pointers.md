Rust, with its concept of ownership and borrowing, has an additional difference between references and smart pointers: while references only borrow data, in many cases, smart pointers _own_ the data they point to.

Though we didn’t call them as such at the time, we’ve already encountered a few smart pointers in this book, including `String` and `Vec<T>` in Chapter 8. Both these types count as smart pointers because they own some memory and allow you to manipulate it. They also have metadata and extra capabilities or guarantees. `String`, for example, stores its capacity as metadata and has the extra ability to ensure its data will always be valid UTF-8.

Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs. Unlike an ordinary struct, smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits.

We’ll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:

-   `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap
-   `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
-   `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time

In addition, we’ll cover the _interior mutability_ pattern where an immutable type exposes an API for mutating an interior value. We’ll also discuss _reference cycles_: how they can leak memory and how to prevent them.
