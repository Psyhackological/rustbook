## [Separating Modules into Different Files](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#separating-modules-into-different-files)

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Filename: src/front_of_house.rs

```rust
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

Once the compiler knows the file is part of the project (and knows where in the module tree the code resides because of where you’ve put the `mod` statement), other files in your project should refer to the loaded file’s code using a path to where it was declared

In other words, `mod` is _not_ an “include” operation that you may have seen in other programming languages.

Filename: src/front_of_house.rs

```rust
pub mod hosting;
```

Filename: src/front_of_house/hosting.rs

```rust
pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
```

### [Alternate File Paths](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#alternate-file-paths)

So far we’ve covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler uses, but Rust also supports an older style of file path. For a module named `front_of_house` declared in the crate root, the compiler will look for the module’s code in:

-   _src/front_of_house.rs_ (what we covered)
-   _src/front_of_house/mod.rs_ (older style, still supported path)

For a module named `hosting` that is a submodule of `front_of_house`, the compiler will look for the module’s code in:

-   _src/front_of_house/hosting.rs_ (what we covered)
-   _src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs_ (older style, still supported path)

If you use both styles for the same module, you’ll get a compiler error. Using a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is allowed, but might be confusing for people navigating your project.

The main downside to the style that uses files named _mod.rs_ is that your project can end up with many files named _mod.rs_, which can get confusing when you have them open in your editor at the same time.

The `mod` keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module.
