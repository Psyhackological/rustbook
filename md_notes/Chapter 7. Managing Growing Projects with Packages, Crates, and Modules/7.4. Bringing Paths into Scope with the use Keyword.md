## [Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword)

Adding `use` and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in the filesystem. By adding `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` in the crate root, `hosting` is now a valid name in that scope, just as though the `hosting` module had been defined in the crate root.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

A `use` statement only applies in the scope it’s in

### [Creating Idiomatic `use` Paths](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#creating-idiomatic-use-paths)

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Bringing the `add_to_waitlist` function into scope with `use`, which is unidiomatic

Bringing the function’s parent module into scope with `use` means we have to specify the parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined while still minimizing repetition of the full path.

On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with `use`, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
```

There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.

The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name into scope with `use` statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that.

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

### [Providing New Names with the `as` Keyword](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#providing-new-names-with-the-as-keyword)

There’s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name into the same scope with `use`: after the path, we can specify `as` and a new local name, or _alias_, for the type.

```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
    Ok(())
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
    Ok(())
}
```

Both are considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!

### [Re-exporting Names with `pub use`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use)

When we bring a name into scope with the `use` keyword, the name available in the new scope is private.

This technique is called _re-exporting_ because we’re bringing an item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into their scope.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a restaurant probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With `pub use`, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different structure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on the library and programmers calling the library.

### [Using External Packages](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#using-external-packages)

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
}
```

pulling any of them into your package involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s _Cargo.toml_ file and using `use` to bring items from their crates into scope.

### [Using Nested Paths to Clean Up Large `use` Lists](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#using-nested-paths-to-clean-up-large-use-lists)

```rust
// --snip--
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
// --snip--
```

```rust
// --snip--
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
// --snip--
```

In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate `use` statements needed by a lot!

We can use a nested path at any level in a path

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::Write;
```

```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
```

### [The Glob Operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#the-glob-operator)

```rust
use std::collections::*;
```

The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test into the `tests` module
