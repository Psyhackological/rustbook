## [Reading a File](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-02-reading-a-file.html#reading-a-file)

```rust
use std::env;
use std::fs;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
    println!("In file {}", file_path);

    let contents = fs::read_to_string(file_path)
        .expect("Should have been able to read the file");

    println!("With text:\n{contents}");
}
```

we need `std::fs` to handle files.

In `main`, the new statement `fs::read_to_string` takes the `file_path`, opens that file, and returns a `std::io::Result<String>` of the file’s contents.

With text:
I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
```

But the code has a few flaws. At the moment, the `main` function has multiple responsibilities: generally, functions are clearer and easier to maintain if each function is responsible for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re not handling errors as well as we could. The program is still small, so these flaws aren’t a big problem, but as the program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly. It’s good practice to begin refactoring early on when developing a program, because it’s much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code.
