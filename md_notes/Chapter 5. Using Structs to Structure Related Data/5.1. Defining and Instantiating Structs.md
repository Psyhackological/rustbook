## [Defining and Instantiating Structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#defining-and-instantiating-structs)

To define a struct, we enter the keyword `struct` and name the entire struct. A struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of the pieces of data, which we call _fields_.

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

In other words, the struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill in that template with particular data to create values of the type.
```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}
```

Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.

### [Using the Field Init Shorthand](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-the-field-init-shorthand)


```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = build_user(
        String::from("someone@example.com"),
        String::from("someusername123"),
    );
}
```

Because the `email` field and the `email` parameter have the same name, we only need to write `email` rather than `email: email`.

### [Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#creating-instances-from-other-instances-with-struct-update-syntax)

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```

The `..user1` must come last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the corresponding fields in `user1`

In this example, we can no longer use `user1` after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of `user1` was moved into `user2`.

### [Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#using-tuple-structs-without-named-fields-to-create-different-types)

Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

### [Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields)

You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called _unit-like structs_ because they behave similarly to `()`

Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

Imagine that later we’ll implement behavior for this type such that every instance of `AlwaysEqual` is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to have a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn’t need any data to implement that behavior!

### [Ownership of Struct Data](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html#ownership-of-struct-data)

> In the `User` struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned `String` type rather than the `&str` string slice type. This is a deliberate choice because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.

> It’s also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of _lifetimes_

> Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.
