## [Test Organization](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#test-organization)

The Rust community thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration tests. _Unit tests_ are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation at a time, and can test private interfaces. _Integration tests_ are entirely external to your library and use your code in the same way any other external code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple modules per test.

Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.

### [Unit Tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#unit-tests)

The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as expected. You’ll put unit tests in the _src_ directory in each file with the code that they’re testing. The convention is to create a module named `tests` in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with `cfg(test)`.

#### [The Tests Module and `#[cfg(test)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest)

The `#[cfg(test)]` annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run the test code only when you run `cargo test`, not when you run `cargo build`. This saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You’ll see that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need the `#[cfg(test)]` annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files as the code, you’ll use `#[cfg(test)]` to specify that they shouldn’t be included in the compiled result.

By using the `cfg` attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only if we actively run the tests with `cargo test`. This includes any helper functions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions annotated with `#[test]`.

#### [Testing Private Functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#testing-private-functions)

There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you adhere to, Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.

```rust
pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));
    }
}
```

Note that the `internal_adder` function is not marked as `pub`. Tests are just Rust code, and the `tests` module is just another module.

If you don’t think private functions should be tested, there’s nothing in Rust that will compel you to do so.

### [Integration Tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#integration-tests)

In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your library in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call functions that are part of your library’s public API. Their purpose is to test whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration tests, you first need a _tests_ directory.

#### [The _tests_ Directory](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#the-tests-directory)

We create a _tests_ directory at the top level of our project directory, next to _src_. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We can then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the files as an individual crate.

```text
adder
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── integration_test.rs
```

Each file in the `tests` directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our library into each test crate’s scope.

We don’t need to annotate any code in _tests/integration_test.rs_ with `#[cfg(test)]`. Cargo treats the `tests` directory specially and compiles files in this directory only when we run `cargo test`.

The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and the doc tests. Note that if any test in a section fails, the following sections will not be run. For example, if a unit test fails, there won’t be any output for integration and doc tests because those tests will only be run if all unit tests are passing.

The integration tests section starts with the line `Running tests/integration_test.rs`.

Each integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the _tests_ directory, there will be more integration test sections.

To run all the tests in a particular integration test file, use the `--test` argument of `cargo test` followed by the name of the file:

```console
cargo test --test integration_test
```

#### [Submodules in Integration Tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#submodules-in-integration-tests)

As you add more integration tests, you might want to make more files in the _tests_ directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the test functions by the functionality they’re testing. As mentioned earlier, each file in the _tests_ directory is compiled as its own separate crate, which is useful for creating separate scopes to more closely imitate the way end users will be using your crate. However, this means files in the _tests_ directory don’t share the same behavior as files in _src_ do

For example, if we create _tests/common.rs_ and place a function named `setup` in it, we can add some code to `setup` that we want to call from multiple test functions in multiple test files:

Filename: tests/common.rs

```rust
pub fn setup() {
    // setup code specific to your library's tests would go here
}
```

When we run the tests again, we’ll see a new section in the test output for the _common.rs_ file, even though this file doesn’t contain any test functions nor did we call the `setup` function from anywhere:

Having `common` appear in the test results with `running 0 tests` displayed for it is not what we wanted. We just wanted to share some code with the other integration test files.

To avoid having `common` appear in the test output, instead of creating _tests/common.rs_, we’ll create _tests/common/mod.rs_. The project directory now looks like this:

```text
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    ├── common
    │   └── mod.rs
    └── integration_test.rs
```

This is the older naming convention that Rust also understands that we mentioned in the [“Alternate File Paths”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#alternate-file-paths) section of Chapter 7. Naming the file this way tells Rust not to treat the `common` module as an integration test file. When we move the `setup` function code into _tests/common/mod.rs_ and delete the _tests/common.rs_ file, the section in the test output will no longer appear. Files in subdirectories of the _tests_ directory don’t get compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test output.

After we’ve created _tests/common/mod.rs_, we can use it from any of the integration test files as a module. Here’s an example of calling the `setup` function from the `it_adds_two` test in _tests/integration_test.rs_:

```rust
use adder;

mod common;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    common::setup();
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
```

#### [Integration Tests for Binary Crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#integration-tests-for-binary-crates)

If our project is a binary crate that only contains a _src/main.rs_ file and doesn’t have a _src/lib.rs_ file, we can’t create integration tests in the _tests_ directory and bring functions defined in the _src/main.rs_ file into scope with a `use` statement.

This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a straightforward _src/main.rs_ file that calls logic that lives in the _src/lib.rs_ file. Using that structure, integration tests _can_ test the library crate with `use` to make the important functionality available. If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in the _src/main.rs_ file will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn’t need to be tested.

## [Summary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#summary)

Rust’s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to ensure it continues to work as you expect, even as you make changes. Unit tests exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private implementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library work together correctly, and they use the library’s public API to test the code in the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust’s type system and ownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to reduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.
