## [Developing the Library’s Functionality with Test-Driven Development](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#developing-the-librarys-functionality-with-test-driven-development)

We can call functions directly with various arguments and check return values without having to call our binary from the command line.

In this section, we’ll add the searching logic to the `minigrep` program using the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:

1.  Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you expect.
2.  Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
3.  Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to pass.
4.  Repeat from step 1!

Though it’s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code design. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.

We’ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of lines that match the query. We’ll add this functionality in a function called `search`.

### [Writing a Failing Test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#writing-a-failing-test)

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn one_result() {
        let query = "duct";
        let contents = "\
Rust:
safe, fast, productive.
Pick three.";

        assert_eq!(vec!["safe, fast, productive."], search(query, contents));
    }
}
```

This test searches for the string `"duct"`. The text we’re searching is three lines, only one of which contains `"duct"` (Note that the backslash after the opening double quote tells Rust not to put a newline character at the beginning of the contents of this string literal). We assert that the value returned from the `search` function contains only the line we expect.

e aren’t yet able to run this test and watch it fail because the test doesn’t even compile: the `search` function doesn’t exist yet! In accordance with TDD principles, we’ll add just enough code to get the test to compile and run by adding a definition of the `search` function that always returns an empty vector, as shown in Listing 12-16. Then the test should compile and fail because an empty vector doesn’t match a vector containing the line `"safe, fast, productive."`

```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    vec![]
}
```

Defining just enough of the `search` function so our test will compile

lifetime parameters specify which argument lifetime is connected to the lifetime of the return value. In this case, we indicate that the returned vector should contain string slices that reference slices of the argument `contents` (rather than the argument `query`).

In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the `search` function will live as long as the data passed into the `search` function in the `contents` argument. This is important! The data referenced _by_ a slice needs to be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we’re making string slices of `query` rather than `contents`, it will do its safety checking incorrectly.

Because `contents` is the argument that contains all of our text and we want to return the parts of that text that match, we know `contents` is the argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime syntax.

Other programming languages don’t require you to connect arguments to return values in the signature, but this practice will get easier over time.

### [Writing Code to Pass the Test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#writing-code-to-pass-the-test)

Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector. To fix that and implement `search`, our program needs to follow these steps:

-   Iterate through each line of the contents.
-   Check whether the line contains our query string.
-   If it does, add it to the list of values we’re returning.
-   If it doesn’t, do nothing.
-   Return the list of results that match.

Let’s work through each step, starting with iterating through lines.

#### [Iterating Through Lines with the `lines` Method](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#iterating-through-lines-with-the-lines-method)

Rust has a helpful method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings, conveniently named `lines`

```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        // do something with line
    }
}
```

The `lines` method returns an iterator.

#### [Searching Each Line for the Query](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#searching-each-line-for-the-query)

Next, we’ll check whether the current line contains our query string. Fortunately, strings have a helpful method named `contains` that does this for us! Add a call to the `contains` method in the `search` function,

```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            // do something with line
        }
    }
}
```

#### [Storing Matching Lines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#storing-matching-lines)

```rust
pub fn search<'a>(query: &str, contents: &'a str) -> Vec<&'a str> {
    let mut results = Vec::new();

    for line in contents.lines() {
        if line.contains(query) {
            results.push(line);
        }
    }

    results
}
```

At this point, we could consider opportunities for refactoring the implementation of the search function while keeping the tests passing to maintain the same functionality. The code in the search function isn’t too bad, but it doesn’t take advantage of some useful features of iterators. We’ll return to this example in [Chapter 13](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch13-02-iterators.html), where we’ll explore iterators in detail, and look at how to improve it.

#### [Using the `search` Function in the `run` Function](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-04-testing-the-librarys-functionality.html#using-the-search-function-in-the-run-function)

```rust
pub fn run(config: Config) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)?;

    for line in search(&config.query, &contents) {
        println!("{line}");
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Excellent! We’ve built our own mini version of a classic tool and learned a lot about how to structure applications. We’ve also learned a bit about file input and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.

To round out this project, we’ll briefly demonstrate how to work with environment variables and how to print to standard error, both of which are useful when you’re writing command line programs.
