## [Working with Environment Variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch12-05-working-with-environment-variables.html#working-with-environment-variables)

Weâ€™ll improve `minigrep` by adding an extra feature: an option for case-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment variable. We could make this feature a command line option and require that users enter it each time they want it to apply, but by instead making it an environment variable, we allow our users to set the environment variable once and have all their searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.
