## [Data Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types)

Keep in mind that Rust is a *statically* typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

### [Scalar Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#scalar-types)

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

<span class="caption">Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust</span>

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

Signed numbers are stored using [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n -
1</sup> - 1 inclusive, where *n* is the number of bits that variant uses. So an `i8` can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup> - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1, so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust

| Number literals  | Example       |
|------------------|---------------|
| Decimal          | `98_222`      |
| Hex              | `0xff`        |
| Octal            | `0o77`        |
| Binary           | `0b1111_0000` |
| Byte (`u8` only) | `b'A'`        |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to `i32`. The primary situation in which you’d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

##### [Integer Overflow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow)

> When you’re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to _panic_ at runtime if this behavior occurs.

> When you’re compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does _not_ include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs _two’s complement wrapping_. In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap around” to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on.

> To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:
> - Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`
> - Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods
> - Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods
> - Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with `saturating_*` methods

#### [Floating-Point Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#floating-point-types)

Rust also has two primitive types for _floating-point numbers_, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64` because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

#### [The Boolean Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-boolean-type)

Booleans are one byte in size.

#### [The Character Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-character-type)

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII.

### [Compound Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#compound-types)

_Compound types_ can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### [The Tuple Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type)

The tuple without any values has a special name, _unit_. This value and its corresponding type are both written `()` and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.

#### [The Array Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-array-type)

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

```rust
let a = [3; 5];
```

##### [Invalid Array Element Access](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#invalid-array-element-access)

When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic.
