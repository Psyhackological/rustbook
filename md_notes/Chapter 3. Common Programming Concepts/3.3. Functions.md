## [Functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#functions)

Technically, the concrete values are called _arguments_, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words _parameter_ and _argument_ interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

### [Statements and Expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#statements-and-expressions)

Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand.

_Statements_ are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. _Expressions_ evaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples.

### [Functions with Return Values](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html#functions-with-return-values)

In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function.
