### [`if` Expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#if-expressions)

Blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions are sometimes called _arms_, just like the arms in `match` expressions

It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code _must_ be a `bool`. If the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error.

#### [Using `if` in a `let` Statement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#using-if-in-a-let-statement)

If the types are mismatched, as in the following example, we’ll get an error:

#### [Repeating Code with `loop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#repeating-code-with-loop)

The symbol `^C` represents where you pressed ctrl-c . You may or may not see the word `again!` printed after the `^C`, depending on where the code was in the loop when it received the interrupt signal.

#### [Repeating Code with `loop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#repeating-code-with-loop)

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such as checking whether a thread has completed its job.

#### [Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops)

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

## [Summary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#summary)

You made it! That was a sizable chapter: you learned about variables, scalar and compound data types, functions, comments, `if` expressions, and loops! To practice with the concepts discussed in this chapter, try building programs to do the following:

- Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
- Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song.
