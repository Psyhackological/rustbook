##### [Stack](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap)

> Think of a stack of plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well!

> All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. 

##### [Heap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap)

> Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

> The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a _pointer_, which is the address of that location. This process is called _allocating on the heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_ (pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating).

> Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to find you.

> Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap).

> Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap, minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership addresses.

### [Ownership Rules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-rules)

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

- Each value in Rust has an _owner_.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### [The `String` Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-string-type)

We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our program.

One reason is that they’re immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it?

Rust has a second string type, `String`. This type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time.

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
```

The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace this particular `from` function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like `string_from`.

### [Memory and Allocation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#memory-and-allocation)

In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string literals are fast and efficient.

With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:

- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our `String`.

In most languages without a GC, it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget, we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with exactly one `free`.

When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop)

A `String` is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the heap that holds the contents.

![[trpl04-01.svg]]
The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` is currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the `String` has received from the allocator.

When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.

![[trpl04-02.svg]]

The representation does _not_ look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large.

![[trpl04-03.svg]]
This is a problem: when `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the same memory. This is known as a _double free_ error and is one of the memory safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1`, Rust considers `s1` as no longer valid.

But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling it a shallow copy, it’s known as a _move_.

![[trpl04-04.svg]]

Rust will never automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any _automatic_ copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.

#### [Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone)

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`.

When you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something different is going on.

#### [Stack-Only Data: Copy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy)

```rust
    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
    ```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn’t moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make.

n other words, there’s no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn’t do anything different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.

If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

Rust won’t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait.

So what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement `Copy`. Here are some of the types that implement `Copy`:

- All the integer types, such as `u32`.
- The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
- All the floating point types, such as `f64`.
- The character type, `char`.
- Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.

### [Ownership and Functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-and-functions)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

### [Return Values and Scope](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#return-values-and-scope)

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without transferring ownership, called _references_.
