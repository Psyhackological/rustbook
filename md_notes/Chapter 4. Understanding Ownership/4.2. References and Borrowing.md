A _reference_ is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

Second, note that we pass `&s1` into `calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than `String`. These ampersands represent _references_, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.

> Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is _dereferencing_, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`.

We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_. As in real life, if a person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have to give it back. You don’t own it.

Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value.

It’s something that new Rustaceans struggle with, because most languages let you mutate whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time. A _data race_ is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
```

We _also_ cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value.

However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s reading of the data.

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{}", r3);
```

The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called _Non-Lexical Lifetimes_ (NLL for short), and you can read more about it in [The Edition Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/ownership-and-lifetimes/non-lexical-lifetimes.html).

Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it’s the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then you don’t have to track down why your data isn’t what you thought it was.

### [Dangling References](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#dangling-references)

In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

```rust
fn main() {
    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String

    &s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
````

>this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from

### [The Rules of References](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#the-rules-of-references)

Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

- At any given time, you can have _either_ one mutable reference _or_ any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.
