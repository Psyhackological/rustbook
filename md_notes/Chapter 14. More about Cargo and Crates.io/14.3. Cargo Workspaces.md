## [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html#cargo-workspaces)

In Chapter 12, we built a package that included a binary crate and a library crate. As your project develops, you might find that the library crate continues to get bigger and you want to split your package further into multiple library crates. Cargo offers a feature called _workspaces_ that can help manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.

### [Creating a Workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html#creating-a-workspace)

A _workspace_ is a set of packages that share the same _Cargo.lock_ and output directory. Let’s make a project using a workspace—we’ll use trivial code so we can concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to structure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. We’ll have a workspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide the main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will provide an `add_one` function, and a second library an `add_two` function. These three crates will be part of the same workspace. We’ll start by creating a new directory for the workspace:

```console
mkdir add
cd add
```

Next, in the _add_ directory, we create the _Cargo.toml_ file that will configure the entire workspace. This file won’t have a `[package]` section. Instead, it will start with a `[workspace]` section that will allow us to add members to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary crate; in this case, that path is _adder_:

```toml
[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
]
```

Next, we’ll create the `adder` binary crate by running `cargo new` within the _add_ directory:

```console
cargo new adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` package
```

At this point, we can build the workspace by running `cargo build`. The files in your _add_ directory should look like this:

```text
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
```

The workspace has one _target_ directory at the top level that the compiled artifacts will be placed into; the `adder` package doesn’t have its own _target_ directory. Even if we were to run `cargo build` from inside the _adder_ directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in _add/target_ rather than _add/adder/target_. Cargo structures the _target_ directory in a workspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on each other. If each crate had its own _target_ directory, each crate would have to recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts in its own _target_ directory. By sharing one _target_ directory, the crates can avoid unnecessary rebuilding.

### [Creating the Second Package in the Workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html#creating-the-second-package-in-the-workspace)

Next, let’s create another member package in the workspace and call it `add_one`. Change the top-level _Cargo.toml_ to specify the _add_one_ path in the `members` list:

```toml
[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
    "add_one",
]
```

```console
cargo new add_one --lib
     Created library `add_one` package
```

Your _add_ directory should now have these directories and files:

```text
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add_one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
```

Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs

```rust
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Now we can have the `adder` package with our binary depend on the `add_one` package that has our library. First, we’ll need to add a path dependency on `add_one` to _adder/Cargo.toml_.

Filename: adder/Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
add_one = { path = "../add_one" }
```

Cargo doesn’t assume that crates in a workspace will depend on each other, so we need to be explicit about the dependency relationships.

```rust
use add_one;

fn main() {
    let num = 10;
    println!("Hello, world! {num} plus one is {}!", add_one::add_one(num));
}
```

Let’s build the workspace by running `cargo build` in the top-level _add_ directory!

To run the binary crate from the _add_ directory, we can specify which package in the workspace we want to run by using the `-p` argument and the package name with `cargo run`:

```console
cargo run -p adder
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/adder`
Hello, world! 10 plus one is 11!
```

#### [Depending on an External Package in a Workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html#depending-on-an-external-package-in-a-workspace)

Notice that the workspace has only one _Cargo.lock_ file at the top level, rather than having a _Cargo.lock_ in each crate’s directory. This ensures that all crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the `rand` package to the _adder/Cargo.toml_ and _add_one/Cargo.toml_ files, Cargo will resolve both of those to one version of `rand` and record that in the one _Cargo.lock_. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies means the crates will always be compatible with each other. Let’s add the `rand` crate to the `[dependencies]` section in the _add_one/Cargo.toml_ file so we can use the `rand` crate in the `add_one` crate:

Filename: add_one/Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

We can now add `use rand;` to the _add_one/src/lib.rs_ file, and building the whole workspace by running `cargo build` in the _add_ directory will bring in and compile the `rand` crate. We will get one warning because we aren’t referring to the `rand` we brought into scope:

The top-level _Cargo.lock_ now contains information about the dependency of `add_one` on `rand`. However, even though `rand` is used somewhere in the workspace, we can’t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add `rand` to their _Cargo.toml_ files as well. For example, if we add `use rand;` to the _adder/src/main.rs_ file for the `adder` package, we’ll get an error:

```console
cargo build
  --snip--
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rand`
 --> adder/src/main.rs:2:5
  |
2 | use rand;
  |     ^^^^ no external crate `rand`
```

To fix this, edit the _Cargo.toml_ file for the `adder` package and indicate that `rand` is a dependency for it as well. Building the `adder` package will add `rand` to the list of dependencies for `adder` in _Cargo.lock_, but no additional copies of `rand` will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured that every crate in every package in the workspace using the `rand` package will be using the same version, saving us space and ensuring that the crates in the workspace will be compatible with each other.

#### [Adding a Test to a Workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html#adding-a-test-to-a-workspace)

For another enhancement, let’s add a test of the `add_one::add_one` function within the `add_one` crate:

Filename: add_one/src/lib.rs

```rust
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(3, add_one(2));
    }
}
```

Now run `cargo test` in the top-level _add_ directory. Running `cargo test` in a workspace structured like this one will run the tests for all the crates in the workspace:

```console
$ cargo test
   Compiling add_one v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/add_one)
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/add_one-f0253159197f7841)

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

     Running unittests src/main.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-49979ff40686fa8e)

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests add_one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

The first section of the output shows that the `it_works` test in the `add_one` crate passed. The next section shows that zero tests were found in the `adder` crate, and then the last section shows zero documentation tests were found in the `add_one` crate.

We can also run tests for one particular crate in a workspace from the top-level directory by using the `-p` flag and specifying the name of the crate we want to test:

```console
$ cargo test -p add_one
    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/add_one-b3235fea9a156f74)

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

   Doc-tests add_one

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
```

This output shows `cargo test` only ran the tests for the `add_one` crate and didn’t run the `adder` crate tests.

If you publish the crates in the workspace to [crates.io](https://crates.io/), each crate in the workspace will need to be published separately. Like `cargo test`, we can publish a particular crate in our workspace by using the `-p` flag and specifying the name of the crate we want to publish.

For additional practice, add an `add_two` crate to this workspace in a similar way as the `add_one` crate!

As your project grows, consider using a workspace: it’s easier to understand smaller, individual components than one big blob of code. Furthermore, keeping the crates in a workspace can make coordination between crates easier if they are often changed at the same time.
