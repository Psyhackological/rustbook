# [Fearless Concurrency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html#fearless-concurrency)

Therefore, rather than making you spend lots of time trying to reproduce the exact circumstances under which a runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will refuse to compile and present an error explaining the problem. As a result, you can fix your code while you’re working on it rather than potentially after it has been shipped to production. We’ve nicknamed this aspect of Rust _fearless_ _concurrency_. Fearless concurrency allows you to write code that is free of subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs.

> Note: For simplicity’s sake, we’ll refer to many of the problems as _concurrent_ rather than being more precise by saying _concurrent and/or parallel_. If this book were about concurrency and/or parallelism, we’d be more specific. For this chapter, please mentally substitute _concurrent and/or parallel_ whenever we use _concurrent_.

Many languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling concurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for message-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state between threads. Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a reasonable strategy for higher-level languages, because a higher-level language promises benefits from giving up some control to gain abstractions. However, lower-level languages are expected to provide the solution with the best performance in any given situation and have fewer abstractions over the hardware. Therefore, Rust offers a variety of tools for modeling problems in whatever way is appropriate for your situation and requirements.

Here are the topics we’ll cover in this chapter:

-   How to create threads to run multiple pieces of code at the same time
-   _Message-passing_ concurrency, where channels send messages between threads
-   _Shared-state_ concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece of data
-   The `Sync` and `Send` traits, which extend Rust’s concurrency guarantees to user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library
